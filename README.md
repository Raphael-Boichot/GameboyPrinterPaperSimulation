This project originates from https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator. This is now a fork of the Arduino Game Boy Printer emulator that increases game compatility to 100% and allows new printing features.

The purpose of this Octave/Matlab project is to output images from an Arduino Game Boy Printer emulator that have the same soft aspect than images printed on a fresh roll of thermal paper into a Game Boy Printer. The project emerges after a discussion between *Raphaël BOICHOT*, *mofosyne*, *maxs - thatguywithagameboycamera*, *herr_zatacke (@herr_gack)*, *Björn (@gameboycameramaniac)*, *R.A.Helllord* and *crizzlycruz (@23kpixels)* on the Gameboy Camera Club Discord. The motivation ? As Game Boy Printer paper is becoming difficult to find and subjected to definitive deterioration with time, emulating it is more and more appealing from an heritage conservation point of view. Fresh thermal paper used in this study was graciously sent to me by *R.A.Helllord* from the Game Boy Camera Club Discord. 

The Game Boy printer emulator developped by Brian Khuu is able to capture a stream of serial data under text form, but transforming this stream into pleasant images that have the realistic aspect of a roll of paper exiting a thermal printer, with the tone, noise, granularity and aliasing due to the printer head, was challenging compared to a classical pixel perfect rendering. And what is challenging is fun.

My first idea was to do a simulation of printer head by replacing hard square pixels by some sort of bell-shaped spots with lots of noise. A 2D bell-shaped approximation had a sense to me as injecting heat in a point on a 2D surface result in gaussian distribution of temperatures. On thermal paper, tones are due to a chemical reaction of a powder deposited on the surface of paper driven by temperature and phase change. I took inspiration from cashier tickets and Game Boy Printer scans at high resolution. Misalignment of the printer head was also simulated. The result of a pure mathematical approach was interesting for sure.

# Let's play with noisy gaussian dots

# The pixel perfect test case :

# Example of an early attempt of paper simulation
![](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/GameboyPrinterPaperSimulation/blob/master/images/2020-08-23/Game_Boy_Printer_e-paper_1.png)

Even if was not bad at all, pixels were too regularly spaced and paper fibers that deform the dots and create vertical streaks on paper were impossible to simulate with this  approach. We need a more agressive design !

# It MUST be like the real thermal paper !

After considering the differences between early outputs and real prints (scanned at 3600 dpi) obtained with a recently bought Pocket Printer, I was still not satisfied by the result. The difficulty is that the printer head and paper grain add noise to the image at different length scales. Moreover, the needles from thermal printer head do not just create noisy gaussian dots. These dots also have a random shape (typically due to fibers in paper). So my new idea was to sample a collection of representative pixels of the different grayscales on a good quality scan of isolated pixels printed with my Game Boy Printer. 

There is no image available to print in Game Boy library that presents perfectly isolated pixels in huge quantity. So I have created a test case with my brand new SD Game Boy printer code https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer

I first printed this test image with isolated pixels of the three different grayscales (white is just ignored):

![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test.png)

Then I scanned a printing of this image at 3600 dpi (sufficient to see the details of pixels, each pixel beeing approx. 20x20 pixels on the scan):

![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test_printed.png)

And I sampled manually a collection of 50 pixels of each level of grayscale (very boring task but quite rewarding at the end): 

![](./images/2020-09-10/Pixel_sample_3600dpi.png)

Then the Octave code just reads a pixel on a pixel perfect image to get its color, picks a random pixel among the 50 of its own "color" and draws it on a new file with some overlapping. 50 pixels of each color is not much, but a pixel is a simple matrix of value. In consequence, to increase randomness each pixel itself is flipped or rotated randomly so that more than 200 different pixels can be generated out of just 50 for each color. Finally, the real printing paper presents fibres that create vertical streaks of "ink" (thermal paper has no ink but you see the idea). So the code randomly decreases the intensity of printing along some streaks of limited length chosen randomly. Of course the code in its present form can be improved, but the result is enough for my poor visual acuity.

I choose to make a test case with a Chip Chip printed from Super Mario Deluxe:
# The pixel perfect test case:
![](./images/2020-09-10/Chip_chip.png)

I then scanned this printing at 3600 dpi (after some contrast enhancement, the printings appear in fact greenish)
# A scan of printed image on a real Game Boy Printer:
![](./images/2020-09-10/Printed.png)

Then I ran Octave with the pixel perfect image and here the result: 
# The e-paper image obtained with Octave:

# Which Game Boy Printer emulator using with the Matlab/Octave decoder ?

The Octave/Matlab decoder is of course natively backward compatible with https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator. However, I've added some new features to the original Game Boy Printer emulator after fruitful discussions with Rafael Zenaro from the Game boy Camera Club :

- *The game compatibility have been increased to 100% by applying two simple rules to the error packets sent by the Printer emulator to games: the error packet is always 0x00 before printing (the games clearly do not mind this error byte most of the time) except when an empty data packet is received, where it becomes 0x04 (image data full). This allows triggering the print command for certain rare games that require this. The post-printing commands are still the ones from the original project, except some increase of the number of busy state commands.*

- *Assembling automatically the images is challenging with some games so a modification of both the emulator and the decoder is proposed to ensure proper printing for a dozen of "difficult" games. This will be called Manual or "TimeOut" mode in opposition to the default Automatic mode using margins to separate images*

The pinout have been slightly modified. The SOUT pin have been moved to D5 to allow direct pin compatibility with this other project: https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer. It is recommanded to add a LED on pin D13 to allow the Arduino to indicate flashing of the board and packet transmission.

# How to use the Game Boy Printer paper emulation ?

You will need: the cheapest Arduino Uno, the cheapest LED, the cheapest wires, the cheapest soldering iron or the cheapest breadboard, a serial cable to sacrify (for example the cheapest chinese clone found on Aliexpress, please do not sacrify original Nintendo cables) and for ease the cheapest multimeter with continuity mode. The total project cost should be around $10 maximum. Wire and/or solder all that stuff, recharge your cheapest NiMH batteries and you are ready for printing.

- Install the last Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and load the .ino file.
- Install the free GNU Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) or use your pricey Matlab license and run the decoder.m.
- Connect your Game Boy to Arduino with serial cable, open the serial console in 115200 bauds and print as with a real Game Boy Printer.
- Copy paste text obtained from the Arduino serial output into Entry_file.txt
- Open Octave/Matlab code "Main_Decoder.m"
- Choose some color palettes and printing options (default are OK).
- Run and wait for completion, code is fast on Matlab, slower with Octave.
- Enjoy your images. The code outputs both pixel perfect and paperlike images, can handle compressed protocol, custom palettes and the many variations of the Game Boy printing protocol.
- The .txt output can also be processed with https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator

Now let's detail the new features available with this version of emulator:

**Automatic mode or print with margins**

Set gbp_serial_io.cpp and Main_Decoder.m like this:

    #define GBP_PKT10_TIMEOUT_MS 400 in gbp_serial_io.cpp line 39
    continuous_printing=0;  in Main_Decoder.m line 13
    
Automatic mode is the mode by default : use default settings and images will be separated by the decoder if an after margin different than zero is detected. Most of the games are happy with that and in particular the Game Boy Camera. For 99% of the users this mode will be enough.

**Manual mode or print with Timeout**

Set gbp_serial_io.cpp and Main_Decoder.m like this:

    #define GBP_PKT10_TIMEOUT_MS 15000 in gbp_serial_io.cpp line 39
    continuous_printing=1;  in Main_Decoder.m line 13

In Manual mode, the printing command from the Game Boy is not taken into account. Instead, you have to wait for the "TimeOut" message to appear into the Arduino serial before making another print. This allows the decoder to know how to assemble images that contains inner margins. Remind that the real printer uses a roll of paper that you decide to cut manually, so certains games do not care of the printing margins. So you have to force a bit the image separation in order to get the nice printing wanted by the programmers.

Games that can take advantage from the "TimeOut" or Manual mode are (for example): 
- *Nakayoshi Cooking (3, 4 and 5), Mc Donald's Monogatari, Hello Kitty no Magical museum and Nintama Rantarou GB: Eawase Challenge Puzzle. They generate splitted image files in Automatic mode due to weird printing protocol with very long lag times in-between chunks of images and/or inner margins.*
- *Mary-Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner and E.T.: Digital Companion have the exact inverse problem : they always print images with no margin by default. Using Manual mode is so advised to split different images.*
- *In general, each time you used the Automatic mode, if the images decoded are splitted, stuck together or in brief, not what you expect in terms of assembly, use Manual mode with TimeOut separator.*

**Direct printing from Matlab/Octave (nearly) without using the Arduino IDE !**

You can run "Read_directly_from_Arduino_Matlab.m" or "Read_directly_from_Arduino_Octave.m" directly to acquire data and decode them in the same run. It behaves like the Arduino Serial output but without the need to copy-paste text output: the decoder is ran automatically as soon as you reboot the Arduino after a printing session. How to use it : 

- Install the last Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and compile/load the .ino file with the TimeOut parameter you need. Note the USB port number, close the IDE, you won't need it.
- Use your pricey Matlab license or the free GNU Octave alternative and modify the script with the correct port number and run it.
- Connect your Game Boy to Arduino with serial cable, it must be like the Arduino serial console but into the Matlab Command window.
- Print your images as usual.
- When you're done, reboot the Arduino, it will indicate to Matlab that transmission is over and will run the decoder automatically.
- Enjoy your images. The code outputs both pixel perfect and paperlike images, can handle compressed protocol, custom palettes and the many variations of the Game Boy printing protocol.
- Code generates an output .txt file that you can process again with the classical decoder "Main_Decoder.m" or with https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator

**Mobile printing !**

With an OTG cable, you can plug, power and control the Arduino directly from your mobile Android phone with Arduinodroid App. Simply copy the output from serial console, paste to Entry_file.txt and decode the images with Matlab Mobile (The App is free with limited cloud storage for unlicensed user, but enough for our case). Matlab Mobile is however not yet able to control directly the Arduino (contrary to PC), perhaps in a future release.

**Known issues related to the printer emulator, Arduino side**

- *Printing with Hamster Club is easily prone to crash due to spamming of the serial console with 0F command in double speed mode*

# List of games that embed a printer library but without printer support for the player

Code analysis of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color romsets revealed that some games (generally sequels of the preceding list) embed a printer library into the code but no printer support for the player. Some of them where clearly intended to use the printer as their gameplay is about unlocking images. The printer support was probably dismissed during game development as most of them are late published Game Boy Color games. Lazy recycling of non-optimized graphical libraries is also not excluded as memory size was less and less critical at this time. Sadly for the fetishists of furs, there was a bunch of hamster related games with printer support removed...

# List of games that display a printer support on the box but without any printing feature confirmed by players

These games display a printer support logo on their box but I did not find any evidence of a printer library into their code (even a remainder) and it seems than nobody on internet was able to print something from them: 

- *Grand Theft Auto (USA version)*
- *The Muppet (USA version)*

# Time for statistics !

- *50 games are for Game Boy Color only (clear cartridges)*
- *49 games are for Game Boy / Game Boy Color (black cartridge)*
- *8 games are for Game Boy only (no color features)*
- *35 games use custom palettes (not 0xE4)*
- *28 games communicate with serial protocol in double speed mode*
- *5 games use an RLE compression in their serial protocol*
- *4 games use a two colors palette on purpose*
