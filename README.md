This project uses the [Arduino Game Boy Printer Emulator](https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator) to get raw printing data and GNU Octave/Matlab to decode them. It is compatible with any of the 110 games compatible with the Game Boy Printer.

This e-paper feature is now included in the [GBCamera-Android-Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) which allows printing and sharing your images online with a mobile phone !

The motivation ? As Game Boy Printer paper is becoming more and more difficult (and damn expensive) to source and subjected to definitive deterioration with time, emulating it is more and more appealing from an heritage conservation point of view. And using 6 AA batteries in 2024, honestly...

The Game Boy printer emulator developped by Brian Khuu which is used here is able to capture a stream of serial data under text form. The project here aims to tranform this hexadecimal text stream into pleasant images that have the realistic aspect of a roll of paper exiting a thermal printer. Reproducing the tone, noise, granularity and aliasing of to the printer head is challenging compared to a classical pixel perfect rendering. And what is challenging is fun.

# My initial trial

My first idea was to do a simulation of printer head by replacing hard square pixels by some sort of bell-shaped spots with lots of noise. A 2D bell-shaped approximation had a sense to me as injecting heat in a point on a 2D surface result in gaussian distribution of temperatures. On thermal paper, tones are due to a chemical reaction of a powder deposited on the surface of paper driven by temperature and phase change. I took inspiration from cashier tickets and Game Boy Printer scans at high resolution. Misalignment of the printer head was also simulated. The result of a pure mathematical approach was interesting for sure.

## Let's play with noisy gaussian dots

## Example of an early attempt of paper simulation
![](images/Early_fake_print.png)

Even if it was not bad at all, pixels were too regularly spaced and paper fibers that deform the dots and create vertical streaks on paper were impossible to simulate with this approach. We need a more agressive design !

# My second trial : it MUST look like the real thermal paper !

After considering the differences between early outputs and real prints (scanned at 3600 dpi) obtained with a recently bought Pocket Printer, I was still not satisfied by the result. The difficulty is that the printer head and paper grain add noise to the image at different length scales. Moreover, the needles from thermal printer head do not just create noisy gaussian dots. These dots also have a random shape (typically due to fibers in paper). So my new idea was to sample a collection of representative pixels of the different grayscales on a good quality scan of isolated pixels printed with my Game Boy Printer. 

There is no image available to print in Game Boy library that presents perfectly isolated pixels in huge quantity. So I have created a test case with my brand new [SD Game Boy printer code](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer)

I first printed this test image with isolated pixels of the three different grayscales (white is just ignored):

![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test.png)

Then I scanned a printing of this image at 3600 dpi (sufficient to see the details of pixels, each pixel beeing approx. 20x20 pixels on the scan):

![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test_printed.png)

And I sampled manually a collection of 50 pixels of each level of grayscale (very boring task but quite rewarding at the end): 

![](./images/2020-09-10/Pixel_sample_3600dpi.png)

Then the GNU Octave/Matlab code just reads a pixel on a pixel perfect image to get its color, picks a random pixel among the 50 of its own "color" and draws it on a new file with some overlapping. 50 pixels of each color is not much, but a pixel is a simple matrix of value. In consequence, to increase randomness each pixel itself is flipped or rotated randomly so that more than 200 different pixels can be generated out of just 50 for each color. Finally, the real printing paper presents fibres that create vertical streaks of "ink" (thermal paper has no ink but you see the idea). So the code randomly decreases the intensity of printing along some streaks of limited length chosen randomly. Of course the code in its present form can be improved, but the result is enough for my poor visual acuity.

# How to use the Game Boy Printer paper emulation ?

You will need: the cheapest Arduino Uno, the cheapest LED, the cheapest wires, the cheapest soldering iron or the cheapest breadboard, a serial cable to sacrify (for example the cheapest chinese clone found on Aliexpress, please do not sacrify original Nintendo cables) and for ease the cheapest multimeter with continuity mode. The total project cost should be around $10 maximum. Wire and/or solder all that stuff, recharge your cheapest NiMH batteries and you are ready for printing.

- Install the last [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and load the .ino file to the board.
- Install the open-source [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) or enjoy your pricey Matlab license.
- Connect your Game Boy to Arduino with serial cable, open the serial console in 115200 bauds and print as with a real Game Boy Printer.
- Copy paste text obtained from the Arduino serial output into  [Entry_file.txt](GameBoyPrinterDecoderMatlab/Entry_file.txt)
- Open Octave/Matlab code [Main_Decoder.m](GameBoyPrinterDecoderMatlab/Main_Decoder.m)
- Choose some color palettes and printing options (default are OK).
- Run and wait for completion, code is fast on Matlab, slower with Octave.
- Enjoy your images. The code outputs both pixel perfect and paperlike images, can handle compressed protocol, custom palettes and the many variations of the Game Boy printing protocol. The Entry_file.txt is automatically backed-up with a unique date/ID so that you can process old printing sessions later or with other tools, for example the [wifi-gbp-emulator](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator).

## The pinout to use for Arduino
![](./images/Arduino_pinout.png)

The difficulty with a Game Boy printer emulator is to know where the images have to be cut automatically. It can appear trivial to human mind (when the print is finished) but it is not for a code (some printing sessions have more than 10 seconds deadtime inbetween packest). 90% of the game sends a margin information that can be detected to cut paper easily (they feed paper to separate images). But about 10% sends nothing (like feed paper with white packets and no margin at all in print command) or margins within a single print. For these "difficult games", a strategy have to be invented. 
Now let's detail how to use the decoder:

**Automatic mode or printing with margins**

Set gbp_serial_io.cpp and Main_Decoder.m like this:

    #define GBP_PKT10_TIMEOUT_MS 400 in gbp_serial_io.cpp line 39
    Timeout_printing=0;  in Main_Decoder.m line 13
    
This is the mode by default: with this settings images will be separated by the decoder if an after margin different than zero is detected. Most of the games are happy with that and in particular the Game Boy Camera. For most of the users this mode will be enough, no need to go farther.

**Idle mode or printing with a time out message**

Set gbp_serial_io.cpp and Main_Decoder.m like this:

    #define GBP_PKT10_TIMEOUT_MS 15000 in gbp_serial_io.cpp line 39
    Timeout_printing=1;  in Main_Decoder.m line 13

In idle mode, the printing command from the Game Boy is not taken into account. Instead, you have to wait for the "Memory Waterline" string to appear into the Arduino serial (which means that the serial is now idle) before making another print. This allows the decoder to know how to assemble images that contains inner margins or no margin at all. Remind that the real printer uses a roll of paper that you decide to cut manually, so certains games do not care of the printing margins. So you have to force a bit the image separation in order to get the nice printing wanted by the programmers.

Games that can take advantage from the idle mode are (for example): 
- *Nakayoshi Cooking (3, 4 and 5), Mc Donald's Monogatari, Hello Kitty no Magical museum and Nintama Rantarou GB: Eawase Challenge Puzzle. They generate splitted image files in Automatic mode due to weird printing protocol with very long lag times in-between chunks of images and/or inner margins.*
- *Mary-Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner and E.T.: Digital Companion have the exact inverse problem : they always print images with no margin by default. Using time out image splitting is mandatory.*
- *In general, each time you used the Automatic mode, if the images decoded are splitted, stuck together or in brief, not what you expect in terms of assembly, use idle mode with time out separator to print.*

**Some more technical trivia**

The game compatibility of the Game Boy Printer emulator have been increased to 100% by applying two simple rules to the error packets sent by the Printer emulator to games: the error packet is always 0x00 before printing (the games clearly do not mind this error byte most of the time) except when an empty data packet is received, where it becomes 0x04 (image data full). This allows triggering the print command for certain rare games that require this. The post-printing commands are still the ones from the original project, except some increase of the number of busy state commands.

**Direct printing from Matlab/GNU Octave without using the Arduino IDE !**

You can run [Read_directly_from_Arduino_Matlab.m](GameBoyPrinterDecoderMatlab/Read_directly_from_Arduino_Matlab.m) or [Read_directly_from_Arduino_Octave.m](GameBoyPrinterDecoderMatlab/Read_directly_from_Arduino_Octave.m) directly to acquire data and decode them in the same run. It behaves like the Arduino Serial output from the IDE but without the need to copy-paste text output: the decoder is ran automatically as soon as you reboot the Arduino after a printing session. How to use it : 

- Install the last [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and compile/load the .ino file with the TimeOut parameter you need. Note the USB port number, close the IDE, you won't need it.
- Use your pricey Matlab license or the free GNU Octave alternative and modify the script with the correct port number and run it.
- Connect your Game Boy to Arduino with serial cable and print. It must behave like with the Arduino serial console but into the GNU Octave/Matlab Command window.
- Print your images as usual.
- Once the printing session is finished, reboot the Arduino, it will indicate to GNU Octave/Matlab that transmission is over and will run the decoder automatically.
- Enjoy your images. The code outputs both pixel perfect and paperlike images, can handle compressed protocol, custom palettes and the many variations of the Game Boy printing protocol.
- Code generates an output .txt file that you can process again later with the classical decoder "Main_Decoder.m" or with the [wifi-gbp-emulator](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator). The text output is also automatically backed-up with a unique ID so that you would never lost your prints.

**Can I modify the palettes of the pixel perfect images or e-paper outputs ?**

The code is of course fully open to modifications. Edit "color_packet.m" and add a new line indicating your desired RGB triplets:

    colors=[255 255 255 168 168 168 84 84 84 0 0 0;% 1 = Black and white
            215 247 215 130 222 73 6 75 145 0 19 26;% 2 = Game Boy Color
            123 130 16 90 121 66 57 89 74 41 65 57;% 3 = Game Boy DMG
            255 255 255 89 255 252 239 42 248 0 0 0;% 4 = CGA
            255 255 255 255 128 128 128 64 64 0 0 0];% 5 = Salmon
 (R G B for white) (R G B for light gray) (R G B for dark gray) (R G B for black)];%Your palette
            
Then just edit "color_packet.m" to seek to the new palette by its line number in "color_packet.m"
        
    color_option=X; %X your custom palette

Same for the paper output, edit "epaper_packet.m" and seek for these commands: 

    if (paper_color==X)
    speckle_image(:,:,1)=speckle_image(:,:,1)*(R/255);
    speckle_image(:,:,2)=speckle_image(:,:,2)*(G/255);
    speckle_image(:,:,3)=speckle_image(:,:,3)*(B/255);
    end
    
X is the number of the e-paper palette and RGB the color levels applied to the whole image. Then just edit "color_packet.m" to seek to the new palette by its number in "Main_decoder.m"

    paper_color=X; %X your custome palette

## Examples of default palette output from the code:
![](images/Palettes.png)

White, blue and yellow papers have the regular tones of official Nintendo papers. Pink is an invented tone that would have been cool in the series.

**Known minor issues related to the printer emulator, Arduino side**

- *Printing with Hamster Club may crash after a certain number of images due to spamming of the serial console with 0F command in double speed mode. Apart from that, printing with this game is rather stable.*
- *Game Boy Camera have an abort command during packet transmission. This command, which have no interest with an emulator, is not supported.*

**Known minor issues related to the decoder, Matlab/GNU Octave side**

- *Direct printing from Matlab/GNU Octave without using the Arduino IDE may crash if the Game Boy reboots into the printing session. The best is to reboot Arduino before the Game Boy to flush decoder text output between each games. Printing with the copy-paste method from the Arduino IDE is totally stable but requires more steps.*
- *The graphical objects (figures) from GNU Octave are very slow to display contrary to Matlab (codes being the sames).*
- *Finally, the way he serial port is handled under Matlab and GNU Octave is not the same, so I had to split the direct printing codes in two versions. All others codes are exactly the sames. I hope the two versions will be merged in a future release.*

# The complete list of games compatible with the Game Boy Printer and the Printer Emulator (ãã±ããããªã³ã¿ - å¯¾å¿ã½ãã)

There is in total 110 games compatible with the Game Boy Printer (and printer emulator). I've tested all of them them on various machines (DMG, GBC, GBA and the Chinese GB Boy Colour clone, serial plugged to the Arduino to print) and can certify the printer support with printer emulator, even if some printing features are very tricky to reach - like making a 100% on some RNG based Japanese kosuge. I used a general purpose flash cartridge (EZ-FLASH Junior) for testing the games I do not own (most of them in fact). Some rare games require the original cartridge (one game uses the uncommon HuC-3 mapper) or another flash cartridge for no obvious reasons (two games with common mappers are only compatible with the [GB SMART 32M](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/GB-SMART-multiboot-rom-manager)). One "game" (SMARTCOM) required a rom modification (I had to hack a hack from [Furrtek](http://furrtek.free.fr/?a=smartcom)) to counterpass a boot sequence trick and allow printing with real hardware. Assessing single or double speed mode in protocol was made with an analog oscilloscope probing the clock pin. I'm probably the only human on earth to have printed with all games compatible with the Game Boy Printer, which is a quite nerdy achievement I admit (but I know at least someone jealous of that).

The .zip file in the repo contains 100% or any% saves ready to use with printer features unlocked for many games, as well as examples of printer emulator output and prints for each of them. See the "Game Boy Printer Emulator - Games Support.xlsx" to check the various hints to print from these games, obscure Japanese and totally WTF ones included. This complete list was established by cross-checking English and Japanese game titles known for using the printer and by rom code analysis to reveal some new ones that were never included in any list before. This list was never published online before june 2021 and contains probably the entire game collection that uses the printer. 

The [NeoGB Printer](https://github.com/zenaro147/NeoGB-Printer) uses the same engine and has exactly the same compatibility with games. It even adds some serial protocol analysis to automate automatic/timeout modes.

There is nevertheless a debatable case: 

- *Mario Artist Paint Studio for N64*

*[Mario Artist Paint Studio](https://tcrf.net/Mario_Artist_Paint_Studio)* is supposed to be compatible with the Game Boy Printer via an unreleased "64GB(?) Cable" ([or just the transfer pak (?)](https://luigiblood.tumblr.com/post/187348407478/reverse-enginnering-the-unreleased-gameboy-printer)) and an unreleased "Game Boy Printer cartridge" possibly used as an overkill buffer/level shifter. Mario Artist Paint Studio contains a complete printer libray and menus for using printers, both grayscale and color. So this game is intended to use the printer but without any documented physical possibility to do this, an essential piece of hardware (the transfer stuff) beeing lacking.

Tips for printing with japanese games : search for these characters: ããªã³ã¿ (Printer) or more rarely ãã±ããããªã³ã¿ (Pocket Printer) in games menu. This sometimes brings you only to the contrast settings for the printer, so persevere. Some games are a real pain to play in japanese as they rely on endless discussions and menus, or need a 100% completion with special events to unlock printing features, but hey, it's for science !

On a more personal side, I found that many Japanese exclusive games are objectively piece of crap, for various reasons sadly not related to barrier langage, like: cryptic gameplay, unfair difficulty, ruthless RNG, boring objectives, endless maps or blatant (but crap) plagiarism of PokÃ©mons. Of course western exclusive games have also their load of shitwares that gave me headaches and very unpleasant gaming sessions, but at least it's documented shit with no surprise. The GBC library overall deserves a "seal of crapiness" except for very few dozens exceptions, east and west sides.

**Feel free to contact me if you know other compatible games, I will be glad to test them, add them to the list and credit you. I still suspect a small handful of games to be lacking in the list but I have no other idea to find them now.**

## List of games that embed a printer library but without printer support for the player

Code analysis of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color romsets revealed that some games (generally sequels of the preceding list) embed a printer library into the code but no printer support for the player. Some of them where clearly intended to use the printer as their gameplay is about unlocking images. The printer support was probably dismissed during game development as most of them are late published Game Boy Color games. Lazy recycling of non-optimized graphical libraries is also not excluded as maskrom size was less and less critical at this time. Sadly for the fetishists of furs, there was a bunch of hamster related games with printer support removed...

- *Bouken! Dondoko-tou (åéº!ãã³ãã³å³¶)*

## List of games that display a printer support on the box but without any printing feature confirmed by players

These games display a printer support logo on their box but I did not find any evidence of a printer library into their code (even a remainder) and it seems than nobody on internet was able to print something from them since more than 20 years. The consensus in 2021 is that these games do not have printer support: 

- *Grand Theft Auto (USA version)*
- *The Muppet (USA version)*

In consequence, I won't include them in the official list. The printer logo on the box is very probably a copy-paste from a generic template made by an *I-don't-give-a-shit-of-this-game* graphist.

## Time for statistics !

On the 110 games compatible with the Game Boy Printer:

- *106 got a physical release in cartridge*
- *72 games were released only in Japan (unlocking printing features being more or less painfull)*
- *52 games are for Game Boy Color only (clear cartridges)*
- *49 games are for Game Boy / Game Boy Color (black cartridge)*
- *9 games are for Game Boy only (no color features)*
- *35 games use custom palettes (not 0xE4)*
- *28 games communicate with serial protocol in double speed mode*
- *5 games use an RLE compression in their serial protocol*
- *4 games use a two colors palette on purpose*
- *3 games use 0x00 as default palette instead of 0xE4 (which is documented is Game Boy programming manual)*
- *4 games belongs to the games leaked in september 2020*
- *1 game uses two palettes in the same image (Alice in Wonderland)*
- *1 game uses a three colors palette on purpose (PokÃ©mon Pinball)*
