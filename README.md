This project originates from https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator. This is now a fork of the Arduino Game Boy Printer emulator that increases game compatility to 100% and allows new printing features.

The purpose of this Octave/Matlab project is to output images from an Arduino Game Boy Printer emulator that have the same soft aspect than images printed on a fresh roll of thermal paper into a Game Boy Printer. The project emerges after a discussion between *Raphaël BOICHOT*, *mofosyne*, *maxs - thatguywithagameboycamera*, *herr_zatacke (@herr_gack)*, *Björn (@gameboycameramaniac)*, *R.A.Helllord* and *crizzlycruz (@23kpixels)* on the Gameboy Camera Club Discord. The motivation ? As Game Boy Printer paper is becoming difficult to find and subjected to definitive deterioration with time, emulating it is more and more appealing from an heritage conservation point of view. Fresh thermal paper used in this study was graciously sent to me by *R.A.Helllord* from the Game Boy Camera Club Discord. 

The Game Boy printer emulator developped by Brian Khuu is able to capture a stream of serial data under text form, but transforming this stream into pleasant images that have the realistic aspect of a roll of paper exiting a thermal printer, with the tone, noise, granularity and aliasing due to the printer head, was challenging compared to a classical pixel perfect rendering. And what is challenging is fun.

My first idea was to do a simulation of printer head by replacing hard square pixels by some sort of bell-shaped spots with lots of noise. A 2D bell-shaped approximation had a sense to me as injecting heat in a point on a 2D surface result in gaussian distribution of temperatures. On thermal paper, tones are due to a chemical reaction of a powder deposited on the surface of paper driven by temperature and phase change. I took inspiration from cashier tickets and Game Boy Printer scans at high resolution. Misalignment of the printer head was also simulated. The result of a pure mathematical approach was interesting for sure.

# Let's play with noisy gaussian dots

# The pixel perfect test case :

# Example of an early attempt of paper simulation
![](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/GameboyPrinterPaperSimulation/blob/master/images/2020-08-23/Game_Boy_Printer_e-paper_1.png)

Even if was not bad at all, pixels were too regularly spaced and paper fibers that deform the dots and create vertical streaks on paper were impossible to simulate with this  approach. We need a more agressive design !

# It MUST be like the real thermal paper !

After considering the differences between early outputs and real prints (scanned at 3600 dpi) obtained with a recently bought Pocket Printer, I was still not satisfied by the result. The difficulty is that the printer head and paper grain add noise to the image at different length scales. Moreover, the needles from thermal printer head do not just create noisy gaussian dots. These dots also have a random shape (typically due to fibers in paper). So my new idea was to sample a collection of representative pixels of the different grayscales on a good quality scan of isolated pixels printed with my Game Boy Printer. 

There is no image available to print in Game Boy library that presents perfectly isolated pixels in huge quantity. So I have created a test case with my brand new SD Game Boy printer code https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer

I first printed this test image with isolated pixels of the three different grayscales (white is just ignored) :

![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test.png)

Then I scanned a printing of this image at 3600 dpi (sufficient to see the details of pixels, each pixel beeing approx. 20x20 pixels on the scan) :
![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test_printed.png)

And I sampled manually a collection of 50 pixels of each level of grayscale (very boring task but quite rewarding at the end) : 

![](./images/2020-09-10/Pixel_sample_3600dpi.png)

Then the Octave code just reads a pixel on a pixel perfect image to get its color, picks a random pixel among the 50 of its own "color" and draws it on a new file with some overlapping. 50 pixels of each color is not much, but a pixel is a simple matrix of value. In consequence, to increase randomness each pixel itself is flipped or rotated randomly so that more than 200 different pixels can be generated out of just 50 for each color. Finally, the real printing paper presents fibres that create vertical streaks of "ink" (thermal paper has no ink but you see the idea). So the code randomly decreases the intensity of printing along some streaks of limited length chosen randomly. Of course the code in its present form can be improved, but the result is enough for my poor visual acuity.

I choose to make a test case with a Chip Chip printed from Super Mario Deluxe :
# The pixel perfect test case :
![](./images/2020-09-10/Chip_chip.png)

I then scanned this printing at 3600 dpi (after some contrast enhancement, the printings appear in fact greenish)
# A scan of printed image on a real Game Boy Printer :

Then I ran Octave with the pixel perfect image and here the result :

# Which Game Boy Printer emulator using with the Matlab/Octave decoder ?

The Octave/Matlab decoder is of course natively backward compatible with https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator. However, I've added some new features to the original Game Boy Printer emulator after fruitful discussions with Rafael Zenaro from the Game boy Camera Club :

- *The game compatibility have been increased to 100% by applying two simple rules to the error packets sent by the Printer emulator to games: the error packet is always 0x00 before printing (the games clearly do not mind this error byte most of the time) except when an empty data packet is received, where it becomes 0x04 (image data full). This allows triggering the print command for certain rare games that require this. The post-printing commands are still the ones from the original project, except some increase of the number of busy state commands.*

- *A push button have been added to the project to allow an alternative mode of printing that mimicks the use of a real printer with a roll of paper: printings are buffered as long as a the push button is not pressed briefly, wich gives a signal of "paper cutting" to the decoder. This allows printing banners for games that allows this*

The pinout have been slightly modified in consequence. A push button was added on D7, the SOUT pin have been moved to D5 to allow direct pin compatibility with this other project: https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer. It is recommanded to add a LED on pin D13 to allow the Arduino to indicate flashing of the board and acknowledgement of the manual push button action.

# How to use the Game Boy Printer paper emulation ?

You will need: the cheapest push button of any kind, the cheapest Arduino Uno, the cheapest LED, the cheapest wires, the cheapest soldering iron or the cheapest breadboard, a serial cable to sacrify (for example the cheapest chinese clone found on Aliexpress, please do not sacrify original Nintendo cables) and for ease the cheapest multimeter with continuity mode. The total project cost should be around $10 maximum. Wire and/or solder all that stuff, recharge your cheapest NiMH batteries and you are ready for printing.

- Install the last Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and load the .ino file.
- Install the free GNU Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) or use your pricey Matlab license and run the decoder.m.
- Connect your Game Boy to Arduino with serial cable, open the serial console in 115200 bauds and print as with a real Game Boy Printer.
- Copy paste text obtained from the Arduino serial output into Entry_file.txt
- Open Octave/Matlab code "Main_Decoder.m"
- Choose some color palettes (default is OK).
- Run and wait for completion, code is fast on Matlab, slower with Octave.
- Enjoy your images. The code outputs both pixel perfect and paperlike images, can handle compressed protocol, custom palettes and the many variations of the Game Boy printing protocol.

Now let's detail the new features available with this version of emulator:

**Automatic mode**

Automatic mode is the mode by default : do not touch anything on the Arduino and images will be separeted by the decoder if an after margin different than zero is detected. Most of the games are happy with that and in particular the Game Boy Camera. If you do not solder the push button on the Arduino pin D7, automatic mode is the only mode available. The Matlab/Octave decoder is OK with that. For most of the users this mode will be enough.

**Manual mode**

In Manual mode, as long as you print in the serial output from Arduino, the decoder will output only one image file. Press the push button inbetween two prints and a message is sent to the serial console to indicate to the decoder that "paper have been cut" and that a new output file have to be made. It can be made inbetween each print and will in this case gives the same result that automatic mode. It can be made after many printings and you will get a big strand of data or a banner. If the decoder detects that push button have been pressed once in a session, all the printing session will be considered as Manual mode (Manual mode, if used, has a priority on Automatic mode). In consequence, avoid mixing both modes in the same printing session (or same output text file). To know when to press the pushbutton, rely on the Game Boy music to ensure that the current printing is finished. The Arduino serial output must be idle when receiving the manual cutting signal.

Games that can take advantage from the Manual mode are: 
- *Nakayoshi Cooking (3, 4 and 5), Mc Donald's Monogatari and Nintama Rantarou GB: Eawase Challenge Puzzle. They generate splitted image files in Automatic mode due to weird printing protocol. Printing in Manual Mode is mandatory with these games.*
- *Mary-Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner and E.T.: Digital Companion have the exact inverse problem : they always print images with no margin by default. Using Manual mode is so advised to split different images.*
- *Super Mario Bros Deluxe and Donkey Kong Country offer the possibility to print banners made of multiple images than each contains margin not equal to zero. To benefit from this feature, Manual mode is mandatory.*
- *In general, each time you used the Automatic mode, if the images decoded are splitted, ill-assembled or in brief, not what you expect in terms of assembly, use Manual mode instead of Automatic mode.*

**100% game compatibility**

The combo Arduino emulator + Octave/Matlab decoder have been tested on all the games on earth compatible with the Game Boy Printer, they all printed perfectly !

# The complete list of games compatible with the Game Boy Printer Emulator

# List of games that embed a printer library but without printer support for the player

Code analysis of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color romsets revealed that some games (generally sequels of the preceding list) embed a printer library into the code but no printer support for the player. Some of them where clearly intended to use the printer as their gameplay is about unlocking images. The printer support was probably dismissed during game development as most of them are late published Game Boy Color games. Lazy recycling of non-optimized graphical libraries is also not excluded as memory size was less and less critical at this time.
