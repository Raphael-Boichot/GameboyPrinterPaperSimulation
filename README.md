Game boy printer emulator with e-paper feature (CrapPrinter)
Code runs very fast with Matlab, slowly with Octave.

This is a companion project with https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator

The purpose of this octave/matlab script is to do an accurate simulation of an
 output of a gameboy printer and the effect of the thermal printer head on the
 gameboy printer roll. This is not the same as a typical receipt printer as you
 will see in the historical writeup below.

# Historical background (As of 2020-08-16)

This conversation occurred in Gameboy Camera Club in discord, contact us for an invite link.

During discussion between *Raphaël BOICHOT* and *maxs - thatguywithagameboycamera*
Raphaël BOICHOT got an idea to simulate the paper output of the gameboy printer.

*herr_zatacke (@herr_gack)* and *Björn (@gameboycameramaniac)* and *crizzlycruz (@23kpixels)* was also in the
chatroom contributing to the discussion of this effort.

> It gives me an idea : it should be possible to make an "after converter" that outputs images having the same soft aspect that printed paper, I mean the tone, noise, granularity and aliasing due to the printer head. Could somebody send me when possible a very high resolution scan of a printed image from GB camera with a real Game Boy printer, so that I can see what to do ? The idea is to make a real fake printed image.

With R.A.Helllord high resolution scan of a real gameboy printer output on good quality paper,
Raphaël BOICHOT obtained a zoomed in sample of the output as ground reference.

He also compared with a typical cash receipt

From here, Raphaël BOICHOT started work on this project. From the sample of a real printer output, he did a simulation of a single speckle.

This allowed him to generate this dot ![](./images/2020-08-17/dot_small.png) and then starting with an original perfect rendering of a gameboy printer output... he carefully crappified it to match the original output in reality.

# Gameboy Printer Paper Simulation V2

After considering many comparisons between the code V1 and real prints obtained with a recently bought Pocket Printer, I was still not satisfied by the result. The difficulty is that the printer adds noise to the image at different length scales, what is particularly difficult to render with a fast code. So my new idea was to sample a collection of representative pixels of the different grayscales on a good quality scan of isolated pixels printed with my printer.

Typically, there is no image available to print in Game Boy library that presents perfectly isolated pixels. My idea was to create a test case with my brand new SD Game Boy printer code :

https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/The-Arduino-SD-Game-Boy-Printer

So I created this test image with isolated pixels of the three different grayscales (white is just ignored) :
![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test.png)

Then I scanned a printing of this image at 3600 dpi (sufficient to see the details of pixels, each pixel beeing approx. 20x20 pixels on the scan) :
![](./images/2020-09-10/Image_test_printed.png)

And I sampled manually a collection of 50 pixels of each level of grayscale (very boring task but quite rewarding at the end) : 
![](./images/2020-09-10/Pixel_sample_3600dpi.png)

Then the Octave code just reads a pixel on a pixel perfect image to get its color, picks a random pixel among the 50 of its own "color" and draws it on a new file with some overlapping. 50 pixels of each color is not much, but a pixel is a simple matrix of value. In consequence, to increase randomness each pixel itself is flipped or rotated randomly so that more than 200 different pixels can be generated out of just 50 for each color. Finally, the real printing paper presents fibres that create vertical streaks of "ink" (thermal paper has no ink but you see the idea). So the code randomly decreases the intensity of printing along some streaks of limited length chosen randomly. Of course the code in its present form can be improved, but the result is enough for my poor visual acuity.

I choose to make a test case with a Chip Chip printed from Super Mario Deluxe :
# The pixel perfect test case :

I then scanned this printing at 3600 dpi (after some contrast enhancement, the printings appear in fact greenish)

Then I ran Octave with the pixel perfect image and here the result :

# Two ways of using the emulator V2 :

- Copy paste game boy serial data obtained from https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator into Entry_file.txt
- Open Octave/Matlab code "Main_Decoder.m"
- Choose some options
- Run and wait
- Enjoy your images

OR

- Choose a pixel perfect image 4 shades of gray from any Game Boy Game using the printer (or any other source)
- Open Octave/Matlab code "Game_Boy_crap_me_directly.m"
- Change the name of the image file to convert
- Run and wait
- Enjoy your 16 millions color 2564x2308 new image

V3 is just and update to follow V3 of the Game Boy Printer emulator, nothing change compared to V2 for user, enjoy it !
